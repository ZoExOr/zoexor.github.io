[Finished at Dec, 2025]

During the Christmas break, I finally took the time to download and finish *A Mind at Play*, which I had been putting off for quite a while.

Perhaps thanks to more than two years of continuous training in engineering-oriented thinking, I found myself strongly resonating with Shannon’s way of approaching problems. He consistently aimed to describe questions in language that was as precise and concise as possible, using formal models to strip away unnecessary complexity. This preference for minimizing expression while maximizing structure closely mirrors the way I’ve learned, over the past few years, to organize and work through my own psychological difficulties.

What I found most satisfying in the book was not the technical details themselves, but Shannon’s attitude toward problems. Rather than rushing to explain the world, he focused first on identifying which variables actually mattered and what truly constituted information. As the idea that only what reduces uncertainty qualifies as information was reinforced again and again, it became increasingly clear to me that a large volume of language does not necessarily imply a large amount of information. Redundancy and noise often do nothing more than make problems appear more complicated than they really are.

After finishing *A Mind at Play*, I went on to download a book on game theory -- a field I had long been curious about. Shannon’s connections with John von Neumann further deepened my interest in mathematical modeling, rational decision-making, and structured thinking. With some mental energy returning over the past few days, I plan to continue along this line and finally work through these areas I’ve been meaning to read more systematically.
